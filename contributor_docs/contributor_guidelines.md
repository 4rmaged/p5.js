# Contributor Guidelines
Welcome to the contributor guidelines! This document is for new contributors looking to contribute code to p5.js, contributors looking to refresh their memories on some technical steps, or just about anything else to do with code contributions to p5.js.

If you are looking to contribute outside of the p5.js repositories (writing tutorials, planning classes, organizing events), please have a look at the other relevant pages instead. Stewards or maintainers may find the [steward guidelines](./steward_guidelines.md) more helpful regarding reviewing issues and pull requests.

This is a fairly long and comprehensive document but we will try to deliniate all steps and points as clearly as possible. Do utilize the table of contents, the browser search functionality (`Ctrl + f` or `Cmd + f`) to find sections relevant to you. Feel free to skip sections if they are not relevant to your planned contributions as well.

# All about issues
The majority of the activity on p5.js' Github repositories (repo for short) happens in issues and issues will most likely be the place to start your contribution process as well.

## What are issues?
Issue is the generic name for a post on Github that aims to describe, well, an issue. This "issue" can be a bug report, a request to add new feature, a discussion, a question, an announcement, or anything that works as a post. Comments can be added below each issue by anyone with a Github account, including bots! It is the place where contributors dicusses topics related to the development of the project in the repo.

While an issue can be opened for a wide variety of reasons, for p5.js' repos we usually only use issues to discuss p5.js source code development related topics. Topics such as debugging your own code, inviting collaborators to your project, or other unrelated topics should be discuss either on the [forum](https://discourse.processing.com) or on other platforms.

We have created easy to use issue templates to aid you in deciding whether a topic should be a Github issue or it should be posted somewhere else!
